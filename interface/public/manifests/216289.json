In this painting, she is shown carrying a vina, a multi-stringed instrument distinct to the Indian subcontinent. Her music has attracted black buck deer, which are also a typical feature in Todi Ragini paintings. Along the lotus-filled river are large cranes. The lush trees seem to rhythmically sway, alluding to the musical nature of the work. This painting is a pictorial metaphor for a raga, a musical phrase that is used as the basis for improvisation.
